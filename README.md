- 👋 Hi, I’m @UtkarshBhardwaj007

- 👀 I am currently in my final year at DTU completing my B.Tech. in Computer Engineering. I’m interested in a lot of things like competitive coding in C / C++ / Python. I have done a lot of projects, 3 internships and worked for 2 research groups in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI and Computer Vision. I also work as a freelancer with clients in more than 10 countries across the world.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development (MERN stack to be exact) so as to be completely capable of deploying websites with a ML backend on my own as a full stack developer.

- 🌱 I have over 8 months of experience in internships alone, 11 months of experience in research teams and over 10 months of experience working as a freelancer.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate through a job preferrably in the following profiles Software Development Engineer or Data Engineer.
